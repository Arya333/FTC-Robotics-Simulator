usage: MatchMaker [-fgbhqes] [-a 2|3] [-l team_list_file] [-m min_match_sep] [-u n] [-Y year] -t team_count -r round_count

             -t  specify number of teams (required)
             -r  specify number of rounds (required)

             -h  print this help screen and exit
             -f  fair quality, shortest compute time (default)
             -g  good quality
             -b  best quality, longest compute time
             -a  specify number of teams per alliance (default is 3)
             -l  give name of file containing team numbers
             -m  specify minimum difference in match numbers between
                   successive matches per team; if not specified,
                   a default will be chosen by the program
             -q  no percent complete or total time feedback (quiet)
             -e  estimate time required to generate specified schedule
             -s  sparse output, easier for scripts to parse
             -u  force surrogates into specified round
             -x  show the range of allowed values for min_match_sep
             -o  override some requirements to allow for small off-season tournaments
             -M  mirror blue alliance stations for balancing

examples:

    MatchMaker -t 54 -r 10          schedule for 54 teams, 10 rounds,
                                      default match separation and quality
    MatchMaker -t 54 -r 10 -m 6     schedule for 54 teams, 10 rounds,
                                      min match delta of 6, default quality
    MatchMaker -g -t 54 -r 10 -m 6  same with 'good' quality, takes longer
                                      to compute
    MatchMaker -b -t 54 -r 10 -m 6  same with 'best' quality, time for a latte

    MatchMaker -t 53 -r 7 -u 3      schedule for 53 teams, 7 rounds,
                                      surrogate matches played in round 3

    MatchMaker ... > matches.txt    instead of printing the schedule to
                                      the console window, write to a file called
                                      matches.txt in the current directory


For RobSim	MatchMaker -g -a 2 -l teams.txt -u 3 -t 49 -r 5 -s
